        <p>
          Alan Grant, Scotland Yard Inspector (a character who also appears in five other novels by the same author) is feeling bored while confined to bed in hospital with a broken leg. Marta Hallard, an actress friend of his, suggests that he should amuse himself by researching a historical mystery. She brings him some pictures of historical characters, aware of Grant's interest in human faces. He becomes intrigued by a portrait of King Richard III. He prides himself on being able to read a person's character from his appearance, and King Richard seems to him a gentle, kind and wise man. Why is everyone so sure that he was a cruel murderer?
          <br><br>
        With the help of other friends and acquaintances, Grant investigates Richard's life and the case of the Princes in the Tower, testing out his theories on the doctors and nurses who attend to him. Grant spends weeks pondering historical information and documents with the help of Brent Carradine, a likable young American researcher working in the British Museum. Using his detective's logic, he comes to the conclusion that the claim of Richard being a murderer is a fabrication of Tudor propaganda, as is the popular image of the King as a monstrous hunchback.          </p>

        <h3>Brief:</h3>
        <p>The narrative alternates between the point of view of Nick and Amy Dunne. Nick's narration begins shortly after arriving home on his fifth wedding anniversary to find Amy is missing; there are signs of a struggle. Amy's narration is comes in the form of her diaries and describes the earlier stages of their relationship.
          <br>
        The diary entries describe how Amy Elliot met Nick in New York City, where they both worked as writers. After two years of dating, they married. In 2009, both lost their jobs following the Great Recession; Amy's parents, also facing financials issues, asked Amy for assistance. The couple relocated to Nick's hometown of North Carthage, Missouri, to take care of Nick's sick mother. With permission, Nick used what remained of Amy's savings to open a bar with his twin sister, Go, and also works as a college lecturer. The state of their marriage deteriorates; Amy describes how she hates being a housewife and resents Nick for making her move. Her diary comes to portray Nick as an aggressive, moody, idle, and threatening husband, and indicates that she fears for her life.
            <br><br>
        In Nick's narrative, he views Amy as needlessly difficult, anti-social, an irrational perfectionist, and an unwelcome obligation, but is concerned about her disappearance. Nick becomes a suspect in the investigation and faces intense media scrutiny, exacerbated by his lack of obvious emotion and apparent flippant attitude. Investigators discover that Amy was pregnant (which Nick was unaware of) and the couple's finances, though Nick downplays their relationship issues. Nick has serious credit card debt, which he claims to have been unaware of, and Amy's life insurance was recently increased by Nick, which he claims was her idea. It becomes apparent to Nick that his wife had secrets from him.

        <h3>Brief:</h3>
        <p>
            On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. At the center of his study are the amoral young killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, who, vividly drawn by Capote, are shown to be reprehensible yet entirely and frighteningly human. In Cold Blood is a seminal work of modern prose, a remarkable synthesis of journalistic skill and powerfully evocative narrative.          </p>

        <h3>Brief:</h3>
        <p>Eight people arrive on a small, isolated island off the Devon coast, each having received an unexpected personal invitation. They are met by the butler and cook-housekeeper, Thomas and Ethel Rogers, who explain that their hosts, Ulick Norman Owen and Una Nancy Owen, have not yet arrived, though they have left instructions.
          <br>
        A framed copy of the old rhyme "Ten Little Niggers"[8] hangs in every guest's room, and on the dining room table sit ten figurines. After supper, a phonograph record is played; the recording accuses each visitor as well as the Rogers of having committed murder, then asks if any of the "prisoners at the bar" wishes to offer a defence.
          <br><br>
        The guests discover that none of them knows the Owens, and Mr Justice Wargrave suggests that the name "U N Owen" is a play on "Unknown". Marston finishes his drink and promptly dies of cyanide poisoning. Dr Armstrong confirms that there was no cyanide in the other drinks, and suggests that Marston must have dosed himself.
          <br>
        Next morning, Mrs Rogers is found dead in her bed, and by lunchtime General MacArthur has also died, from a heavy blow to the head. The guests realise that the nature of the deaths corresponds with the respective lines of the rhyme; and three of the figurines are found to be broken.
        <br><br>
        The guests suspect that U N Owen may be systematically murdering them, and fruitlessly search the island. But as the island has no hiding places, and no one could have arrived or left, they are forced to conclude that one of the seven remaining persons must be the killer. The next morning, Rogers is found dead while chopping wood, and Emily Brent is found dead in the drawing room having been injected with potassium cyanide.
