        <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
        <p>Nanami Momozono is a high schooler who has a lot on her plate. Her father had evaded his enormous gambling debts by escaping town, which resulted in his daughter being evicted by the debt collectors. As Nanami muses about her future, she runs into a man hanging onto a tree to escape a dog. She rescues him and tells him about her current situation, prompting the man to offer her his home. He believes that Nanami is more suited than him to be the "Master" of the house, and thus she takes him up on his offer.
            <br><br>
        Upon arrival, however, Nanami discovers that said house is actually a dilapidated shrine. She is about to double back when a fox familiar and two shrine spirits stop her, mistaking her for their former master Mikage, the land god of the shrine. Upon realization, Tomoe—the fox familiar—leaves the shrine, refusing to serve Nanami. After a series of events leaves Nanami in grave danger, she summons Tomoe and seals a contract with him to earn his subservience. Now a human land god, Nanami must face new daunting tasks, menacing adversaries, and her handsome and hot-headed familiar.

        <p>Ash Lynx is a beauty, a genius—and a murderer. Since childhood, he had been in the care of Dino "Papa" Golzine, the mafia boss who turned him into the ruthless killer he is now. At first, Ash was just a pretty face for Golzine’s pleasure, but now estranged from him, a 17-year-old Ash runs his own gang with an iron fist.

          Eiji Okumura is a young Japanese photographer. Traveling to New York as an assistant, Eiji is set to work on a report about kids living in the streets. There, he meets teenage gang leader Ash and is mesmerized by the boy—who in turn is curious about Eiji's different lifestyle.

        <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
        <p>Takashi Natsume is a 15-year-old boy who wants nothing more but to live a normal life like everyone else. But to his dismay, like his deceased grandmother, Reiko, he possesses the ability to see “youkai,” or spirits. Natsume eventually discovers that Reiko had bequeathed to him a book of contracts in which she had bound youkai—the “Book of Friends.” However, without Reiko ever calling upon the spirits’ names, they have been left in a confined state. Now, these spirits continuously pursue Natsume in the hopes of having their contracts dissolved for freedom.
            <br><br>
        While there may be gentle, harmless spirits which come to Natsume for help, there are also malicious, hostile spirits that threaten him. This is where Madara steps in, a spirit disguised as a rotund cat. Commonly referred to as Nyanko-sensei by Natsume, Madara is a self-proclaimed bodyguard who has his own motives for accompanying Natsume.

        <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
        <p>Once upon a time, the kingdom of Kouka was ruled by a red dragon in human form. By his side, four warriors imbued with dragon blood helped him lead the kingdom to prosperity. Time passed, and this tale became a legend to tell children.
            <br>
          As the sole princess of Kouka, Yona lives a life of lavish ease. In love with her cousin, Su-won, and protected by her bodyguard, Son Hak, she wants for nothing and remains sheltered from the harrowing reality outside the castle walls. Contrary to this peaceful illusion, Kouka is about to undergo a political upheaval. After her beloved Su-won stages a bloody coup and murders her father, Yona is forced to flee with only Hak by her side.
              <br><br>
          Though surrounded by enemies on all sides, the banished princess still yearns to save her kingdom. Her solution comes from an exiled priest, who tells her that her only hope is to find the four legendary dragon warriors. Guided by this seemingly fictitious myth, Yona sets out to find these warriors, determined to restore her kingdom.
