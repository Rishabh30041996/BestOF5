        <h3>Brief:</h3>
        <p>Sancia Grado is a thief, and a damn good one. And her latest target, a heavily guarded warehouse on Tevanneâ€™s docks, is nothing her unique abilities canâ€™t handle.
           <br>
        But unbeknownst to her, Sanciaâ€™s been sent to steal an artifact of unimaginable power, an object that could revolutionize the magical technology known as scriving. The Merchant Houses who control this magicâ€”the art of using coded commands to imbue everyday objects with sentienceâ€”have already used it to transform Tevanne into a vast, remorseless capitalist machine. But if they can unlock the artifactâ€™s secrets, they will rewrite the world itself to suit their aims.
           <br><br>
        Now someone in those Houses wants Sancia dead, and the artifact for themselves. And in the city of Tevanne, thereâ€™s nobody with the power to stop them.
           <br>
      To have a chance at survivingâ€”and at stopping the deadly transformation thatâ€™s under wayâ€”Sancia will have to marshal unlikely allies, learn to harness the artifactâ€™s power for herself, and undergo her own transformation, one that will turn her into something she could never have imagined.</p>

        <h3>Brief:</h3>
        <p>Dark forces are on the rise in this sweeping sequel to The Black Witch by critically acclaimed author Laurie Forest.
        <br>
        Elloren Gardner and her friends were only seeking to right a few wrongs when they rescued a Selkie and freed a military dragon. The last thing they expected was to be thrust into a realm-wide underground resistance against Gardnerian conquest.
        <br><br>
      While the Resistance struggles to fight back against the harsh rulings of the Mage Council, more and more Gardnerian soldiers descend upon the University...led by none other than Lukas Grey, now commander of the nearby military base. Though Elloren tries to keep him at armâ€™s length, Lukas is determined to tie himself to her, still convinced that she is the heir to the power of the Black Witch, a legacy of magic that will decide the future of all Erthia. As his own magic calls out to her, seeking to awaken a dark force within, Elloren finds it more and more difficult to believe that sheâ€™s truly powerless, as her uncle always claimed.
        <br>
      Caught between her growing feelings for the rebellious Yvan Guriel and the seductive power offered by Lukas, Elloren must find a way to stay true to what she knows is right and protect everyone she loves...even if that means protecting them from herself.

          WITHOUT THE DARKNESS, LIGHT HAS NO PURPOSE. WITHOUT THE VILLAIN, WHAT WOULD THE GODS DO?
          <br><br> INDIA, 3400 BCE. A land in tumult, poverty and chaos. Most people suffer quietly. A few rebel. Some fight for a better world. Some for themselves. Some donâ€™t give a damn. Raavan. Fathered by one of the most illustrious sages of the time. Blessed by the Gods with talents beyond all. Cursed by fate to be tested to the extremes. A formidable teenage pirate, he is filled with equal parts courage, cruelty and fearsome resolve. A resolve to be a giant among men, to conquer, plunder, and seize the greatness that he thinks is his right. A man of contrasts, of brutal violence and scholarly knowledge. A man who will love without reward and kill without remorse. This exhilarating third book of the Ram Chandra series sheds light on Ravaan, the king of Lanka. And the light shines on darkness of the darkest kind. Is he the greatest villain in history or just a man in a dark place, all the time? Read the epic tale of one of the most complex, violent, passionate and accomplished men of all time.          </p>
