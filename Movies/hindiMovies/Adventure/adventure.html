        <h3>Storyline:</h3>
        <p>Jodhaa Akbar is a sixteenth century love story about a marriage of alliance that gave birth to true love between a great Mughal Emperor, Akbar and a Rajput princess, Jodhaa. Politically, success knew no bounds for Emperor Akbar, After having secured the Hindu Kush, he furthered his realm by conquest until his empire extended from Afghanistan to the Bay of Bengal, and from the Himalayas to the Godhavari River. Through a shrewd blend of tolerance, generosity and force, Akbar won the allegiance of the Rajputs, the most belligerent Hindus. But little did Akbar know that when he married Jodhaa, a fiery Rajput princess, in order to further strengthen his relations with the Rajputs, he would in turn be embarking upon a new journey - the journey of true love. The daughter of King Bharmal of Amer, Jodhaa resented being reduced to a mere political pawn in this marriage of alliance, and Akbar's biggest challenge now did not merely lie in winning battles, but in winning the love of Jodhaa.

        <h3>Storyline:</h3>
        <p>In the small village of Ramgarh, the retired policeman Thakur Baldev Singh summons a pair of small-time thieves that he had once arrested. Thakur feels that the duo â€“ Veeru and Jai â€“ would be ideal to help him capture Gabbar Singh, a dacoit wanted by the authorities for a â‚¹50,000 reward. Thakur tells them to surrender Gabbar to him, alive, for an additional â‚¹20,000 reward.
              <br><br>
          The two thieves thwart the dacoits sent by Gabbar to extort the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons attack Ramgarh during the festival of Holi. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Though Thakur has a gun within his reach, he does not help them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. The two are, however, upset at Thakur's inaction, and consider leaving the village. Thakur explains that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members, and had both his arms cut off a few years earlier, which is why he could not use the gun. He had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl.
