        <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
        <p>Kogarashi Fuyuzora has been haunted by the supernatural since birth, which possesses him at every opportunity. This eventually led to him being thrown out of his apartment and starting a vagrant life as an exorcist. One day, he discovers the Yuragi Manor, a boarding house with suspiciously cheap rent. Formerly a hot springs inn, legend has it that a student's body was found there, which has haunted it ever since. Eager to have a roof to live under and exorcise ghosts in the meantime, Kogarashi begins his stay at the manor.
          <br><br>
        While relaxing in the hot springs, Kogarashi happens to encounter this rumored ghost. However, as he prepares to exorcise it, the malevolent ghost turns out to be a charming silver-haired girl! Having no intention to harm her, Kogarashi decides to help the ghostâ€”who he learns is called Yuunaâ€”discover her regrets so she can move on to the afterlife before she turns into an evil spirit.

        <h3>Synopsis: </h3>
        <p>Monstersâ€”they're real, and they want to date us! Three years ago, the world learned that harpies, centaurs, catgirls, and all manners of fabulous creatures are not merely fiction; they are flesh and bloodâ€”not to mention scale, feather, horn, and fang. Thanks to the "Cultural Exchange Between Species Act," these once-mythical creatures have assimilated into society, or at least, they're trying.
          <br><br>
        When a hapless human named Kurusu Kimihito is inducted as a "volunteer" into the government exchange program, his world is turned upside down. A snake-like lamia named Miia comes to live with him, and it is Kurusu's job to take care of her and make sure she integrates into his everyday life. Unfortunately for Kurusu, Miia is undeniably sexy, and the law against interspecies breeding is very strict. Even worse, when a ravishing centaur girl and a flirtatious harpy move in, what's a full-blooded young man with raging hormones to do?

        <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
        <p>When Tatsuhiko Kido moves to the city to attend art school, all he wants is a normal college life full of fun, friends, and cute girls. But his life takes a dramatic change when he peers through a hole in his apartment wall and sees his neighbor Emiru Ikuno masturbating while facing his direction. To make matters worse, he was caught peeping by Emiru, so he barges into the next room to apologize. Unfortunately, he falls into a compromising position with Emiru who quickly snaps a photo and blackmails him into having a mutual peeping relationship. And to make matters more interesting, he learns that Emiru is in his class at school!
          <br><br>
        Although initially curious and only somewhat peeved by their relationship, it begins tearing at Kido's psyche, his sanity, and the relationships he has with other women. Despite its smutty appearance, Nozoki Ana is a deeply psychological story about guilt, eroticism, and finding love in strange places.

        <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
        <p>Hachimitsu Private Academy, an elite all-girls high school, opens its grandiose doors to male students for the first time in its history. The five males who enroll, however, are a merry band of perverts who are unable to communicate with girls! This cluster of misfits is composed of the foreign delinquent Shingo, the strange and sickly "Jo," the overweight "Andrei," the intelligent "Gakuto," and Kiyoshi, the most normal person of the bunch.
          <br><br>
        Feeling troubled due to their lack of female interaction, the five boys embark on a dangerous mission to peek on several girls while they are bathing. However, owing to a series of mishaps, their operation ultimately fails, resulting in the boys' actions being exposed to the entire school.
